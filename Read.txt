Contextual Language Understanding with Transformer Models

🚀 Project Overview
This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Transformer-based deep learning models to perform:
✅ Sentiment Analysis – Classifies text as positive or negative.
✅ Text Summarization – Condenses long text into key points.
✅ Question Answering – Extracts precise answers from a given context.

Built using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, the project provides an interactive interface to demonstrate powerful NLP techniques in real-world applications.

🔧 Key Features
🔹 Sentiment Analysis – Understands emotions behind text.
🔹 Text Summarization – Converts lengthy text into a concise summary.
🔹 Question Answering – Answers questions based on contextual input.
🔹 Scalable & Extensible – Easily adaptable for various NLP applications.

Follow the interactive menu to explore different NLP tasks.

📌 Example Outputs
Sentiment Analysis
Input: "I love this!"
Output: { label: "POSITIVE", score: 0.99 }

Text Summarization
Input: "A very long article explaining a concept..."
Output: "This is a brief summary of the text."

Question Answering
Input:
Context: "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France."
Question: "Where is the Eiffel Tower?"
Output: "Paris, France"
